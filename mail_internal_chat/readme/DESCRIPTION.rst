When messages are logged on a document chatter and internal users
are tagged with `@`, the user being tagged will be notified and can answer
in a chat window.
In any case, answering in the chat window will send a message to all followers
of the document, including external partners, even if the original message was
internal and posted using the "Log a note" tab. This is not the case answering
in the Discussions app will respect the original message type.
This module adds a "Keep Chat Internal" checkbox on message subtypes to avoid
sending any message sent from the chat window to external followers.
